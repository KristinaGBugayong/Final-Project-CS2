📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

Climate Change Calculator  

🔍 Problem Statement

The Philippines experiences a plethora of typhoons per year. Weather events are becoming more extreme, temperature deviations may affect food supply, among other issues. Additionally, a lot of Philippines cities utilize outdated flood data, implying most infrastructure today are no longer built for the changes the country has experienced today.

This program is a simple yet possibly significant part of weather analysis and predictions, and climate monitoring. It can aid in real world aspects such as: Number one, Agriculture and Farming through indicating whether conditions for crops are suitable enough. Number two, Flood and Disaster readiness through alerting citizens of possible rainfall events. Lastly, number three, Urban Planning to inform infrastructure design and energy systems.

The Philippines is eerily vulnerable to climate change, experiencing 20 or so typhoons per year. This can result in loss of livelihoods, loss of homes, death, a lack of food, and other issues. If this problem is not solved, it can result in extreme poverty of both the people and the government.  

🎯 Project Objectives

1. Find: Find out the day with the highest recorded rainfall
2. Infer: Infer the average daily temperature.
3. eXamine: eXamine data, and aid in interpretation and decision making.
   
⚙️ Planned Features

Your program must have at least 5 features (minimum).
We have provided 2 starter ideas for each dataset — you must design at least 3 additional features.

- Feature 1: (Find the day with the highest rainfall.)
- Feature 2: (Compute the average daily temperature.)
- Feature 3: (Analyze how wind speed varies with different weather statuses.)
- Feature 4: (Find the day with the highest wind speed.)
- Feature 5: (Determine the average wind speed for the week.)
(You may add more features if you like.)

⌨️ Planned Inputs and Outputs

Inputs

What kind of data will the user provide (if any)?
Example: student ID, date range, product name
Outputs

- The user would have to provide the highest and lowest recorded rainfall in a specific area, along with the highest and lowest recorded daily temperature in that area and the possible weather forecast for the week. This will find the average rainfall and daily temperature in order to determine if agriculture and farming are suitable in the area, along with disaster preparation and readiness for heavy rainfall.

What kind of results will your program display?
Example: class averages, top products, weather summary

- The program will display the weather summary, such as the average temperature and the average rainfall in the area in order to establish the risks and appropriate safety measures to be taken in the event of an extreme weather event. In addition, based on the weather summary, the program will also determine the appropriate type of urban planning or structures that will be constructed to better adapt to the weather in the area.
