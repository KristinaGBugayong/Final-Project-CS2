📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

Climate Change Calculator  

🔍 Problem Statement

The Philippines experiences a plethora of typhoons per year. Weather events are becoming more extreme, temperature deviations may affect food supply, among other issues. Additionally, a lot of Philippines cities utilize outdated flood data, implying most infrastructure today are no longer built for the changes the country has experienced today.

This program is a simple yet possibly significant part of weather analysis and predictions, and climate monitoring. It can aid in real world aspects such as: Number one, Agriculture and Farming through indicating whether conditions for crops are suitable enough. Number two, Flood and Disaster readiness through alerting citizens of possible rainfall events. Lastly, number three, Urban Planning to inform infrastructure design and energy systems.

The Philippines is eerily vulnerable to climate change, experiencing 20 or so typhoons per year. This can result in loss of livelihoods, loss of homes, death, a lack of food, and other issues. If this problem is not solved, it can result in extreme poverty of both the people and the government.  

🎯 Project Objectives

1. Find: Find out the day with the highest recorded rainfall
2. Infer: Infer the average daily temperature.
3. eXamine: eXamine data, and aid in interpretation and decision making.
